## [Unreleased]

### Breaking Changes

- **Pinchy-Odoo: read-write operator templates now request all foreign-key lookup models they need.** Bookkeeper-style agents previously could not enumerate `account.account` (chart of accounts) when posting bills, because the template only listed write targets (`account.move`, `account.move.line`) and not the read-only models referenced by their foreign keys (`account_id`, `currency_id`, …). Same fix applied to CRM Assistant, Procurement Agent, Project Manager, Production Operator and Approval Manager. The Odoo sync probe list now also includes `res.users` so manager assignments work without a manual "Add model" step. A new drift-guard test (`agent-templates-fk-deps`) keeps the requiredModels list in sync with realistic FK dependencies for future template changes. Existing Odoo connections need a re-sync (Settings → Integrations → Odoo → ⋯ → Sync now) to pick up the new models.

- **Pinchy-Odoo: integration-ref encryption key now auto-provisioned through pinchy-web.** Before %%PINCHY_VERSION%%, `odoo_attach_file` and related write tools could fail with "Invalid integration reference" on freshly upgraded deployments because the `PINCHY_REF_TOKEN_KEY` env var was not set and the in-container `/app/secrets` fallback directory didn't exist in the OpenClaw image. pinchy-web now generates a key on first `regenerateOpenClawConfig()` call, persists it in the settings DB (alongside `openclaw_gateway_token`), and materialises it into the shared `secrets.json` bundle so the OC-side `pinchy-odoo` plugin can read it. No customer action required; the key is created automatically on the next pinchy startup after upgrade. Setting `PINCHY_REF_TOKEN_KEY` as an env-var override is still respected for dev/test.

- **Pinchy-Odoo `odoo_schema` tool replaced.** Splits into `odoo_list_models` (lists permitted models — cheap discovery) and `odoo_describe_model` (compact-by-default field schema with optional `fields` filter, `limit`, and `verbose` parameters). Existing agents are auto-migrated on next startup: any agent with `odoo_schema` in its allowed-tools list gets `odoo_list_models` + `odoo_describe_model` instead. Reduces typical schema-call context cost by ~90 % and unblocks Bookkeeper-style flows on response-format-sensitive models (`ollama-cloud/gemini-3-flash-preview`). The old `odoo_schema` tool name is kept as a deprecated alias so existing `AGENTS.md` files that reference it (Bookkeeper, HR Operator, Warehouse Operator, etc. created before v0.5.4) keep working — calls through the alias now use the compact format too. The alias is slated for removal in v0.6.x.
