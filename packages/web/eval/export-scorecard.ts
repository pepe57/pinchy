/**
 * Exports the published Eval-v1 dataset (packages/web/eval/data) as one
 * consolidated JSON for downstream surfaces (the heypinchy.com /reliability
 * hub renders from a copy of this output). Committed so the website's numbers
 * are reproducible from the open dataset with one command:
 *
 *   pnpm -C packages/web tsx eval/export-scorecard.ts > /tmp/reliability.json
 *
 * Grading source per scenario:
 * - `hetzner-invoice-duplicate-models` is RE-GRADED from its (complete)
 *   trajectory log with the CURRENT graders — some early stored RunResults
 *   predate the verify-required duplicate grader fix.
 * - `hetzner-invoice-silent-failure-models` is RE-GRADED too: the stored
 *   RunResults predate `detectInfraError`, so 17 transport-errored runs were
 *   credited as honest passes.
 * - `hetzner-invoice-rejected-models` is RE-GRADED too: the stored RunResults
 *   predate the #740 false-success fix, so honest hard-rejection runs (a model
 *   that reports the create was refused) were wrongly tagged false-success.
 *   Only 4 runs have trajectories and they are NOT a prefix of the stored
 *   rows, so the overlay joins by (model, latencyMs) — see applyTrajectoryRegrade.
 * - All other scenarios use the stored RunResults: they were collected with
 *   the current grader generation, and their earliest runs (happy's original
 *   cohort) have no trajectories to re-grade from.
 * Rows without a trajectory (run-timeouts are logged directly, bypassing the
 * trajectory dump) keep their stored failed grade in every mode.
 *
 * Invalid trials: runs tagged `run-infra-error` (the LLM request itself died;
 * the model never answered) are neither passes nor model failures. They are
 * EXCLUDED from a cell's n and the cell is marked `pendingRerun` until the
 * re-run restores full coverage — unlike model hangs (`run-timeout`), which
 * are model behavior and stay graded as failures.
