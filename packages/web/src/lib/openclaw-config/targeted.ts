/**
 * Ensure Pinchy's restart-class overrides are present in openclaw.json BEFORE

 * via WS config.apply, hit OC 5.3's BASE_RELOAD_RULES_TAIL `gateway` /
 * `discovery` / `canvasHost` / `update` rules (kind:"restart") and trigger
 * a SIGUSR1 → in-process restart that crashes with
 * `ConfigMutationConflictError: config changed since last load` (OC 5.3
 * stale-snapshot bug in `prepareGatewayStartupConfig → ensureGatewayStartupAuth →
 * replaceConfigFile`). The cascade is the failure mode behind the Telegram
 * E2E `agent-create-no-restart.spec.ts` "OpenClaw never quiet for 30000ms"
 * flake on this branch.
 *
 * Why a targeted write rather than running full `regenerateOpenClawConfig()`
 * unconditionally in bootInits: the full regenerate broke the integration
 * test's basic chat (`Pinchy agent responds via OpenClaw`) — the agent failed
 * with `404 status code (no body)` from fake-ollama on `ollama/llama3.2`,
 * apparently because the bootInits-time regenerate's models/agents block
 * (built from an empty DB) interfered with later setup-wizard regenerate +
 * OC's model registry refresh on hot-reload. Restricting the bootInits write
 * to ONLY the gateway/discovery/canvasHost/update fields avoids that
 * interaction while still aligning OC's compare baseline.
 *
 * This function is idempotent: if the file already has all four overrides
 * with their expected values, no write happens. The skip path also handles
 * the production case (Docker-managed named volume populated from the image's
 * baked-in `config/openclaw.json`, which already carries these fields) — the
 * volume content matches Pinchy's expected overrides → no write → no diff
 * surface for OC to react to.

 * an auth token — the log line is "Refusing to bind gateway to lan without
 * auth". Earlier OC versions self-bootstrapped a random token at first start
 * when `gateway.auth.token` was missing; with the new strict check, the OC

 *
 * This function runs unconditionally in bootInits() — before the
