/**
 * A server-side record of an in-flight chat run.
 *
 * Why this exists: when the Browser ↔ Pinchy WebSocket dies mid-stream, the
 * Pinchy ↔ OpenClaw connection keeps draining the stream — but nothing on
 * Pinchy knows the run is still going, who owns it, or whether anyone is
 * still listening. `ActiveRun` is the missing piece (issue #310, Tier 2).
 *
 * `sessionKey` is the primary key. We do not key by runId because at the
 * moment a reconnect happens the client knows only the sessionKey — it has
 * no way to discover the runId until the server tells it. One sessionKey
 * has at most one active run at a time: a new user turn replaces the
 * previous run (mirroring OC's own behavior).
 *
 * `listeners` is the set of currently-connected browser WebSockets that
 * should receive chunks for this run. After a reconnect Tier 2b joins the
 * new ws as a listener (see `addListener`); multi-tab support shows up for
 * free here because two tabs on the same session naturally end up in the
 * same set.
