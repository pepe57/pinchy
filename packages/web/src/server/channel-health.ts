/**
 * Channel-health classification (issue: silent cross-environment Telegram
 * getUpdates-409 conflict — A-1/A-2).
 *
 * OpenClaw owns the channel pollers (Telegram, Slack, …); when a second
 * deployment polls the same bot token, Telegram returns 409 and OpenClaw's
 * channel worker enters a CPU-burning auto-restart loop. That degradation is
 * invisible to Pinchy at the gateway-WebSocket level — but it IS exposed in
 * `client.channels.status()`. `classifyChannelStatus` turns that raw, opaque
 * payload into per-account health verdicts the watchdog can act on.
 *
 * The shape (`channelAccounts.<channel>[]` with `connected` / `running` /
 * `lastError` / `restartPending` / `reconnectAttempts`) was captured from live
 * OpenClaw 2026.6.1 — see channel-health.fixtures.ts. The parsing is
 * deliberately defensive: the payload is typed `Record<string, unknown>` by
 * openclaw-node, so a field rename upstream degrades to "treat as degraded /
 * default safely" rather than throwing.
