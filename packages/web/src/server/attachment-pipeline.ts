 * Server-side second phase of the two-phase upload flow.

 * Looks up the staged upload rows by `(id, userId, agentId, status=staged)`,

 * durable `uploads/` path, flips the DB row to `attached`, emits per-file
 * `file.upload.attached` audit events, and returns the same
 * `ProcessAttachmentsResult` shape used by the WS send-path.
 *
 * Throws:
 *   `AttachmentNotFoundError`        — id missing or owned by another user/agent
 *   `AttachmentExpiredError`         — staged file has passed `expiresAt`
 *   `AttachmentAlreadyAttachedError` — row is already `attached`
 *
 * **Note on partial failure:** If `promoteStagedToAttached` or the subsequent
 * FS read throws for file N after files 0..N-1 have already been promoted,
 * earlier files are durably placed in `uploads/` and their rows are `attached`
 * in the DB. This partial state cannot be automatically rolled back (FS rename
 * and DB write are not transactional). If this function throws, callers should
 * treat the entire send as failed and inform the user to retry — but the
 * already-promoted rows are pinned to THIS frame's freshly-minted `messageId`
 * UUID. A retry generates a different `messageId`, so the orphaned rows
 * never re-enter the chat stream. They sit in `uploads/` as durable but
 * unreachable artefacts; only an operator (or a future workspace-GC pass)
 * can reclaim them. The trade-off here is intentional: partial-failure is
 * very rare (it requires an FS or DB error mid-loop), and the recovery cost
 * is bounded — the user still sees the failure surface and retries with a
 * clean set of staged rows.

 * persist the system prompt — that gets rebuilt on every turn from the agent
 * config. If we put the upload paths into the system prompt, then on Turn 2
 * the agent's *own history view* of Turn 1 contains "Was steht in dieser

 * whichever upload was discussed at length in the recent assistant response,
 * even when the user's new turn carries a brand-new file.
 *
 * Embedding the path-list in the user message text fixes this: the file ↔ turn
 * mapping is now part of the immutable message record. As a bonus, on history
 * reload we can parse the same block back out and render the file chip without
 * any separate persistence layer.
 *
 * The block is wrapped in a `<pinchy:attachments>` tag (not a markdown heading
 * or code fence) so the strip/parse step on the display side has an
