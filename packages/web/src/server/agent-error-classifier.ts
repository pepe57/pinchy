/**
 * Umbrella classifier for OpenClaw error chunks that reach the chat WS error
 * surface. Used for `chat.agent_error` audit-log measurement (issue #355) —
 * categorises every error chunk into a small set of stable labels so the
 * audit table can be aggregated by class without ad-hoc string matching at
 * query time.
 *
 * Separate from the specialised classifiers in `model-error-classifier.ts`:
 * those decide whether to fire a richly-typed audit event (model_unavailable,
 * upstream_format_error) and require model context. This one runs on every
 * error chunk regardless, including the silent-stream timeout path where
 * Pinchy synthesises the error itself.
 *
 * The `silent_stream_timeout` label is not pattern-matched — it is mapped
 * from a `SynthesisedErrorReason` via `classifySynthesisedError()`. Call
 * sites that synthesise their own error frame must use that helper rather
 * than passing a string literal, so adding a future synthesised-error site
 * is a compile error here (forces a new `SynthesisedErrorReason` arm and a
 * matching `AgentErrorClass` label) instead of a silent audit-coverage gap.
