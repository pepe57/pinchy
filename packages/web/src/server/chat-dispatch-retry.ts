// packages/web/src/server/chat-dispatch-retry.ts
//
// Defensive wrapper for the window after a fresh-install setup (or any
// config-reload / gateway restart) where Pinchy has created an agent and
// confirmed it via `config.get`, but OpenClaw's `agent` RPC dispatch handler
// still rejects the id with `errorCode=INVALID_REQUEST errorMessage="invalid
// agent params: unknown agent id <uuid>"`.
//
// Why a BOUNDED RETRY LOOP rather than a single shot:
//
// `config.get` reads the config FILE; the dispatch handler checks the APPLIED
// runtime `agents.list`. The two diverge until OC finishes applying the
// reload. Normally that lag is 1–2 s. But on a fresh install the lag balloons:
// the cold-start regeneration storm (firstConnect seed + provider save +
// agent-model update) plus OC 5.3's `config.apply` rate-limit (~3 calls per
// 45 s) plus the secrets-bootstrap gateway pkill (config/start-openclaw.sh,
// ~40 s respawn) push the real `agents.list` apply out by up to ~90–120 s.
// Observed directly on PR #448 CI: the first chat dispatched at 13:22:04 hit
// "unknown agent id" and the agent only became dispatchable at 13:23:58 —
// a 114 s gap that a single 500 ms retry could never bridge, surfacing
// "Smithers couldn't respond" on a brand-new user's first message.
//
// `config.get`-based readiness gates (waitForAgentInRuntime, the
// `agentDispatchable` health probe) CANNOT close this race: they poll the same
// file-vs-runtime-divergent path. The only reliable readiness signal is a
// dispatch that actually succeeds — so we retry the real dispatch with
// exponential backoff until it lands or a wall-clock budget elapses.
//
// Safety: this ONLY retries the literal `unknown agent id` shape, and ONLY
// when it is the FIRST chunk. For an agent Pinchy just created and confirmed,
// that error is ALWAYS the transient apply-lag — a genuinely bad id would be a
// Pinchy bug (Pinchy owns the id), and after the budget we surface the error
// rather than loop forever. Errors after the first chunk, and any other error
// shape, pass straight through to the caller's existing error path. So the
// loop cannot mask provider failures, schema rejections, or stream truncation.
//
// No orphaned OC runs: a retried attempt failed because OC REJECTED the
// dispatch ("unknown agent id", ~25 ms, before any run is created), so there is
// no server-side run to leak. Breaking the `for await` on the rejection also
// returns the underlying chat generator, releasing its request.
