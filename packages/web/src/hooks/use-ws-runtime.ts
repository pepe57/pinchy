 * lifecycle event suspended us — i.e. we may have missed frames while the
 * client wasn't listening. Server history is the canonical record in that
 * case, so we adopt it.
 *
 * Conditions:
 *   - Recovery flag is set (otherwise this is an ordinary initial load —
 *     the status reducer handles in-flight reconciliation).
 *   - History is non-empty (an empty frame can mean "upstream OpenClaw is
 *     unreachable", which is never canonical when we already have content).
 *   - The last non-error local message either is an assistant turn
 *     (mid-stream disconnect — server is canonical), OR is an acked user
 *     turn AND server history is strictly longer than what we have locally.
 *
 * The second clause is the fix for issue #310: when the WS drops between
 * `ack` and the first chunk, the local list ends with an acked user
 * message. OpenClaw still completes the turn and persists the reply, so
 * server history has [..., user, assistant] while local has [..., user].
 * Without this clause the reconcile gate fires `false`, the synthetic
 * "The agent didn't respond." orphan bubble surfaces, and retries pile up
 * duplicate user turns.
 *
 * Why the `status === "sent"` guard: a "sending" user message is one we
 * queued during the disconnect (see `pendingMessagesRef` handling). The
 * server hasn't acknowledged it yet, so a longer history must be from a
 * previous turn — replacing would silently drop the queued message.
 *
 * Known limit (in scope for #310 Tier 2, not this gate): the `status ===
 * "sent"` guard also excludes user messages whose `status` is `undefined`,
 * which happens when the last user message in `prevMessages` came from a
 * prior history reconcile (history-derived messages don't carry a delivery
 * status). This blocks reconcile in a rare multi-tab scenario where Tab A
 * opens a chat with an in-flight assistant turn from Tab B, then Tab A's
 * WS drops before the chunks arrive. Tier 2 closes this via the server-
 * side `activeRun` signal — see #310 follow-ups.
