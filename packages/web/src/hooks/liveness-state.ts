/**
 * Pure state machine for agent-run liveness shown in the chat UI.
 *
 * The cardinal rule: the `failed` status may ONLY be entered from an
 * authoritative terminal `failed` event coming from the server (which gets it
 * from the OpenClaw gateway). It is structurally impossible for a timer or a
 * soft "slow" hint to ever produce `failed` — that false-failure (the old
 * "The agent didn't respond" 60s timer bug) is made unrepresentable here.
 *
 * `slow` is only a display hint meaning "still responding, taking longer than
 * expected". It is never a failure and never alters a non-responding state.
