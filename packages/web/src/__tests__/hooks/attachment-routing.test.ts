/**
 * Routing tests for the CompositeAttachmentAdapter wired up in use-ws-runtime.
 *
 * The composite picks the FIRST adapter whose `accept` matches a file. As of
 * PR #342 (two-phase upload pipeline), the adapter chain ONLY handles inline-
 * text routes (code-text + office .docx). Workspace binaries (PDF, image, CSV,
 * plain text, Markdown, JSON, YAML) bypass the adapter chain entirely — they
 * flow through `PinchyAttachmentButton` / `PinchyDropZone` →
 * `addPendingUpload` → POST `/api/agents/<id>/uploads`. The composite MUST
 * reject those types so a future regression that re-adds a binary adapter to
 * the composite would fail this test instead of silently dual-routing files.
 *
 * Issue #392 (preserved invariant): CSV / plain-text / Markdown / JSON / YAML
 * files must NOT be inlined as text by the code-text adapter. The expression
 * is now "composite rejects them" rather than "binary adapter accepts them"
 * — same invariant, different architecture.
 *
 * Code files (.ts, .py, .go, .css) must still inline as text.
