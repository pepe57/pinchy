/**
 * Drift guard for the OpenClaw version pin.
 *
 * OpenClaw's version lives in two places that must stay in lockstep:
 *
 *   1. `Dockerfile.openclaw` — `RUN npm install -g openclaw@X.Y.Z` installs the
 *      runtime that actually answers Gateway RPCs.
 *   2. `packages/web/package.json` — `devDependencies.openclaw` is the SINGLE
 *      source `next.config.ts` reads to populate `NEXT_PUBLIC_OPENCLAW_VERSION`,
 *      which `/api/version` and the diagnostics bundle report to operators.
 *
 * If these drift, `/api/version` lies: it reports a version the container is not
 * running. That is the exact failure class the release-version guards exist to
 * stop for Pinchy's own version (assert-package-version.mjs) — this test extends
 * the same contract to the OpenClaw pin, which has no other guard.
 *
 * Structural check so the drift trips here at `pnpm test` instead of in a
 * post-release `/api/version` smoke test.
