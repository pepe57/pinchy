/**
 * These assertions pin the capability flags that Pinchy curates for Ollama
 * Cloud models to what the live API actually does — not to what the
 * ollama.com/library/<name> pages claim. The pages are documented as
 * unreliable (see the file header), so each non-obvious flag below was
 * verified empirically against https://ollama.com/v1/chat/completions:
 *
 *  - Vision was probed by sending base64 image payloads carrying a random,
 *    non-guessable 4-digit number plus a colored circle and checking the
 *    reply against the ground truth across several distinct images. A model
 *    that returns the correct number/color sees the image; one that returns
 *    HTTP 400 ("does not support image input") or hallucinates wrong content
 *    on a 200 does not.
 *  - Tools were probed by offering a function schema and checking for a
 *    structured `tool_calls` response.
