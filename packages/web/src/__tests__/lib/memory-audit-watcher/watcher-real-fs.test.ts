// Linux-only end-to-end smoke for `startMemoryAuditWatcher`.
//
// The sibling file `watcher.test.ts` mocks chokidar entirely so the assertions
// stay deterministic under vitest's parallel-test load (fsevents on macOS was
// the 33% flake source — see f3051365f). That refactor protected against the
// flake but opened a coverage gap: nothing in the test suite exercised real
// chokidar → real fs → audit-emit end-to-end anymore.
//
// This file closes that gap on Linux. CI is Linux and uses inotify, which is
// delivered from the kernel and is immune to JS event-loop starvation; the
// original flake was specifically a macOS-fsevents-under-load problem. macOS
// keeps using the mocked suite because we can't afford to re-introduce the
// dev-loop flake.
//
// IMPORTANT: this file deliberately does NOT call `vi.mock("chokidar", ...)`.
// `vi.mock` is file-scoped, so the watcher.test.ts mock does not bleed into
// this file. Both files run under the same vitest pool but with separate
// module graphs per-file.
//
// Tracks #433.
