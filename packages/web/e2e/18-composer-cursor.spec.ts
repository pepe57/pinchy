/**
 * Regression guard for the v0.5.4 composer cursor-jump bug.
 *
 * A defensive onChange wrapper around `ComposerPrimitive.Input` (added in
 * commit 7044e12ea to fix a dead-key sync issue) called
 * `composerRuntime.setText(e.target.value)` on every non-composing
 * keystroke. assistant-ui's primitive already does that internally —
 * Pinchy's wrapper double-fired the same state update, and the combined
 * re-render path collapsed the textarea's selection to the end after
 * every keystroke.
 *
 * User-visible symptom: editing in the middle of an existing draft loses
 * the caret after every typed character. Inserting "XYZ" between "hello"
 * and " world" produces "helloX worldYZ" instead of "helloXYZ world",
 * because only the first character lands at the intended position before
 * the caret jumps back to the end.
 *
 * jsdom unit tests can't catch this — DOM selection and the
 * textarea.value imperative-rewrite path that triggers the jump are
 * browser-specific. Playwright drives a real Chromium so this test
 * exercises the same flow a user does.
