/**
 * E2E regression for #193: creating an agent must NOT trigger a full
 * gateway restart on a stable stack.
 *
 * Background — staging-observed cascade (2026-05-01):
 *   Pinchy's `regenerateOpenClawConfig()` was non-idempotent for
 *   `channels.telegram.enabled`. OpenClaw's auto-enable step writes
 *   `enabled: true` back to openclaw.json on every gateway start;
 *   Pinchy's preservation allow-list lacked the field, so the next
 *   regenerate (e.g. POST /api/agents) stripped it. OpenClaw then
 *   diff'd the file, decided the change required a full process restart,
 *   restarted, auto-enabled again, re-added the field — endless loop.
 *   User-visible symptom: "Agent runtime is not available right now"
 *   banner for 15-30 s after every settings save.
 *
 * What this test reproduces:
 *   1. Wait for stable connectivity (cold-start cascade settled — this
 *      is the part that made the previous E2E from #203 flaky and got
 *      it dropped; here it's pure setup, never raced against).
 *   2. POST /api/agents with a fresh custom agent.
 *   3. Read OpenClaw logs for the next 10 s and assert:
 *      a) `agents.list` reload event WAS detected — proves the config
 *         push reached runtime (regression for #200 fix).
 *      b) NO `requires gateway restart` line — the bug fingerprint.
 *      c) NO `received SIGUSR1` line — defense-in-depth in case OpenClaw
 *         renames the restart-trigger log shape.
 *
 * Robustness choices vs the dropped agent-hot-reload.spec.ts:
 *   - No browser, no LLM round-trip, no chat WebSocket assertion.
 *     Removes Playwright timing flakes, model-prewarm timeouts, and
 *     mock-provider auth races as causes of false failures.
 *   - Deterministic log scan with a timestamp `--since` window, not
 *     "wait for some text to appear in the UI within X seconds."
 *   - Stable-wait is setup-only (15 s of continuous connectivity before
 *     the test action), not a race-during-test.

 * (✗ keep waiting). The previous heuristic was "any log line in the last
 * 10 s" — that broke after the restart-cascade fix because the test's
 * subject (idle OC) genuinely produces zero logs for 30+ s once Pinchy
 * stops issuing applies, and the heuristic interpreted that as a hang.
 *
 * Implementation note: probe via the OpenClaw container's bundled `node`
 * (always present in the openclaw image — `npm install -g openclaw@…`).
 * Don't reach for `sh -c 'echo > /dev/tcp/...'` — Debian/Ubuntu base images
 * symlink `/bin/sh` to `dash`, which does NOT implement bash's `/dev/tcp`
 * pseudo-device, so the redirect would silently fail with "No such file or

/**
 * Wait until the OpenClaw gateway has been quiet (no restart events) for
 * at least `quietMs`. WS connectivity alone is unreliable: a hot-reload
 * doesn't drop the WS, but a full restart 10–20 s later still ruins the
 * test. We scan OpenClaw's logs directly for the canonical restart
 * markers and require them to be older than `quietMs`.
 *
 * Markers we treat as "restart happened" (any of):
 *   - `[gateway] received SIGUSR1; restarting`
 *   - `[reload] config change requires gateway restart`
 *   - `[gateway] received SIGTERM; shutting down` (start-openclaw.sh kill)
 *   - `[gateway] ready` — included intentionally even though it's the
 *     trailing edge of a restart, not the leading edge: every cold-start
 *     stack emits at least one of these. By treating it as a marker we
 *     correctly wait `quietMs` after the gateway becomes operational, not
 *     just after the SIGUSR1 fires.
 *
 * Liveness guard: an empty log window is ambiguous — could be "OC's Node.js
 * event loop blocked" (CI load, 30+ s zero-log stalls observed at
 * eventLoopDelayMaxMs=6526 ms) or "OC is genuinely idle, doing nothing
 * because nothing is happening on the gateway". The cascade-restart fix on
 * this branch eliminated the SIGUSR1 storm that previously kept producing
 * log activity, so post-fix idle OC sustains 30+ s of zero logs in the
 * normal happy path. We can't distinguish via logs — so we TCP-probe the
 * gateway port as the definitive liveness signal. A successful connect
 * means the Node.js event loop is processing accept()s, ergo not blocked.
 *
 * Zombie-startup guard: SIGUSR1 → child restart → on rare CI timing the
 * child fails to load config with `ConfigMutationConflictError` and writes
 * a `gateway.restart_startup_failed.json` stability bundle. The process
 * stays alive (per OpenClaw's own design) but the gateway is in a
 * degraded state — TCP listens, WS can't fully handshake, new
 * config.apply RPCs are rejected with "invalid handshake". Without a
 * subsequent `[gateway] ready` line confirming recovery, declaring this
 * state "quiet" gives the caller a false green that propagates into the
 * actual test — which then sees ~zero log activity around its POST
 * because OpenClaw can't process the agent-create config change.
 * Scan a wider window for the failed-bundle marker and require a later
 * "ready" before considering the gateway recoverable.
