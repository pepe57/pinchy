# PRESERVES each plugin's node_modules: those are installed solely by the
# OpenClaw container (start-openclaw.sh) from baked /opt/<plugin>-deps bundles
# and are the only copy, so a pinchy-only restart must never wipe them. Logic +
# its regression test live in config/sync-plugins.sh / sync-plugins.test.ts

# in packages/web/src/lib/openclaw-config/plugin-manifest-loader.ts; drift is
