# this script can do because it runs as root.
#
# The directory's mode (0770, owner 999) means Pinchy's atomic temp+rename
# in writeSecretsFile() still works after we chown the resulting file: rename
# is a directory-level operation. Pinchy replaces the file → file flips back
# to 999-owned → mtime watcher detects → this script chowns again before the

# faster than Pinchy can hit the EACCES window. 0.2s tick keeps the worst
# case under 250ms — comfortably inside Pinchy's readExistingConfig retry
# budget (5 × 100ms). Was 3s previously, which let Pinchy give up before
# the chmod caught up and silently wrote a stripped config (see
# fix(openclaw-config): guard targeted writes against EACCES read).
# 0.05 s tick (was 0.2 s): tightened in May 2026 after the Docker smoke
# test's `Verify OpenClaw config writable by Pinchy` step caught the race
# more often once Pinchy started writing openclaw.json earlier in
# bootInits (cascade-prevention seed in `seedRestartClassOverridesIfMissing`,
# more file activity = more 600-mode windows for OpenClaw's restart writes).
# 50 ms is well under the 5 s `docker compose exec stat` round-trip the
# test uses, so the race is effectively closed. Cost is ~80 chmod calls/s
# on an idle gateway — measured negligible (chmod on a known path is a
# kernel-only operation, no syscalls past inode lookup).
