## What is Pinchy?

Pinchy is an enterprise layer on top of [OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw) — the open-source AI agent framework. OpenClaw is incredibly powerful for individual power users. But for teams and companies, critical pieces are missing: permissions, audit trails, user management, and governance.

Pinchy fills that gap.

### The Problem

You want AI agents in your company. But:

- **Cloud platforms** (Dust, Glean, Copilot Studio) send your data to external servers. For regulated industries in the EU, that's a non-starter.
- **Workflow builders** (n8n, Dify) let you chain steps visually — but they're not autonomous agents.
- **Frameworks** (CrewAI, LangChain) are libraries, not platforms. No UI, no permissions, no deployment story.
- **OpenClaw** is the best open-source agent runtime — but it has no user management, no role-based access, no audit trail.

### The Solution

Pinchy wraps OpenClaw into something enterprises can trust:

- **Plugin Architecture** — Agents get scoped tools, not raw shell access. A "read Odoo sales orders" tool, not `exec`. Each tool is granted explicitly, per agent.
- **Role-Based Access Control** — Who can use which agent. What each agent can do. Per team, per role.
- **Audit Trail** — Every agent action logged. Who, what, when. Cryptographically signed and verifiable.
- **Web & Telegram** — Reach agents in a web UI or from Telegram on your phone. One bot per agent, with the same permissions and audit trail.
- **Self-Hosted & Offline** — Your server, your data, your models. Works without internet.
- **Model Agnostic** — OpenAI, Anthropic, local models via Ollama. Your choice.

### How Pinchy compares

|                                          | OpenClaw alone | Cloud platforms (Dust, Glean) | Workflow tools (n8n) |    **Pinchy**     |
| ---------------------------------------- | :------------: | :---------------------------: | :------------------: | :---------------: |
| Self-hosted, data stays in-house         |       ✅       |              ❌               |          ✅          |      **✅**       |
| Agent-first (not flow-first)             |       ✅       |              ✅               |      flow steps      |      **✅**       |
| Per-agent tool permissions (allow-list)  |       ❌       |            partial            |      flow-level      |      **✅**       |
| Roles & per-user access                  |       ❌       |              ✅               |         paid         |      **✅**       |
| Tamper-evident audit trail (HMAC-signed) |       ❌       |            partial            |    execution log     |      **✅**       |
| Chat UI + Telegram for end users         |    partial     |              ✅               |          ❌          |      **✅**       |
| Odoo ERP integration                     |       ❌       |              ❌               |      connectors      |      **✅**       |
| Open source                              |       ✅       |              ❌               |      fair-code       | **✅ (AGPL-3.0)** |

Honest caveats: Pinchy is young, the integration list is short (Odoo, email — Gmail & Microsoft 365, Telegram, web search, documents), there is no compliance certification yet, and granular RBAC is on the roadmap.

## Quick Start

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/heypinchy/pinchy/v0.7.0/docker-compose.yml -o docker-compose.yml
docker compose up -d
# Open http://localhost:7777 — the setup wizard creates your admin account
```

That is the whole thing: one command, no build step, pre-built images on GHCR. Pair it with a local model via [Ollama](https://docs.heypinchy.com/guides/ollama-setup/) and nothing ever leaves your network. Full setup, configuration, and development instructions: **[Installation Guide](https://docs.heypinchy.com/installation/)**.

## Status

> Pinchy is in early development. The core is working — setup, auth, multi-user, agent chat, permissions, knowledge base agents, and audit trail. We're building the enterprise features (granular RBAC, plugin marketplace, cross-channel workflows) next.

### What works today

- **Setup wizard** — Create your admin account on first run
- **Authentication** — Credentials-based login with database sessions
- **Multi-user** — Invite users, admin and user roles, personal and shared agents
- **Agent chat** — Real-time WebSocket chat with OpenClaw agents, conversation history
- **Agent permissions** — Allow-list model for agent tools (safe and powerful categories)
- **Agent settings** — Configure name, model, system prompt, and tool permissions per agent
- **Knowledge Base agents** — Create agents with scoped read-only access to specific directories
- **Context management** — Per-user personal context and organization-wide context, editable in Settings
- **Email integration** — Connect Gmail or Microsoft 365 mailboxes via OAuth; agents can read, search, draft, and send email with per-agent permissions
- **Smithers onboarding** — New users get an onboarding interview where Smithers learns about them through conversation
- **Provider management** — Configure API keys for Anthropic, OpenAI, and Google
- **Docker Compose deployment** — Single command to run the full stack
- **Audit trail** — Cryptographic audit logging with HMAC-signed entries, integrity verification, and CSV export
- **CI pipeline** — Automated linting, testing, and security auditing

### What's coming

- Full RBAC with team-scoped permissions
- Plugin marketplace for agent tools
- Cross-channel workflows (email, Slack)
- Admin dashboard with usage analytics

## Origin Story

Pinchy started when an AI agent sent a WhatsApp message it shouldn't have — leaking its entire internal reasoning process to a friend instead of a simple "Sure, let's grab lunch!" That moment made one thing clear: AI agents without proper guardrails are a liability, not an asset.

## Philosophy

We care about how Pinchy _feels_, not just what it does. Security + Ease is our core tension — enterprise-grade protection that feels light, not intimidating. Smart defaults everywhere, personality templates instead of blank slates, zero-config setup, and full customization when you need it.
